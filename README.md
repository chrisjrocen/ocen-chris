Portfolio to be deployed on netlify


# Question

This should not limit your creativity, feel free to make additions.

Your portfolio should have a welcome section.
The welcome section should have an ​ h1​ element with your names and a p (paragraph) element that contains text about yourself and what you do.
You should have an image of yourself in the welcome section. The image should appear beside your name and the paragraph that describes you. 
Your portfolio should have a projects section.
The projects section should contain at least one element with a class of ​ project-tile​ to hold a project’s title, project description, and screenshot image of the project. (Hint: you can add projects you have worked on before)
When any of the projects in the project section is clicked on, someone should be redirected to the live preview of the project. For example, I could redirect a user to this page if my project was a survey form. 
All images should have an alt attribute to describe the image and should be responsive.
My portfolio should have a navbar at the top of the viewport. This requires the navbar to remain fixed at the top of the page. 
The navbar should contain at least one link that a website visitor can click on to navigate to different sections of the page.
 The sections named “My portfolio”, should have a contact me section with some social media icons which when clicked can open any of your social media profiles in a new tab.
 The height of each section should be equal to the viewport’s height.
The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
Use an appropriate Google font to style the content of your portfolio.
Your website should be responsive. (This is Important)
Feel free to add other sections which are appropriate for your portfolio.
Your HTML should be organized into appropriate semantic sections .i.e header, main content, footer, and Navigation bar.
Host your portfolio project on Netlify.
